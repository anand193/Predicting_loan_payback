🎯 Loan Payback Prediction — Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict whether a customer will successfully repay a loan based on financial, demographic, and credit-related attributes. The solution uses a trained Machine Learning model integrated into an interactive Streamlit application, enabling real-time predictions with a user-friendly interface.
